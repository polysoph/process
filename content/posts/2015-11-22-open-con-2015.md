On Saturday, I had the chance to attend [OpenCon 2015](http://www.opencon2015.org/acs/opencon_2015_toronto), an offshoot from [a larger conference](http://www.opencon2015.org/) in Brussels about the future of open access, open data, and open science.

Hosted at the Mozilla's Toronto office, the event involved talks from a number of local open science advocates, such as [John Dupuis](http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/), head of York University's Steacie Science Library, and [Keith McDonald](https://about.me/keithmcdonald), the City of Toronto's Open Data Lead.

[Arliss Collin's](https://mozillascience.org/u/arlissc) talk _Building Open Projects on the Web_ shared interesting initiatives like [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), a workshop series to introduce scientists to the technical skills they need to manipulate and work with digital data, and [Mozilla Science Lab's](https://www.mozillascience.org/) [Collaborate project](https://www.mozillascience.org/collaborate), which helps scientists call for the help of external collaborators when their research leads them to areas outside of their expertise.

These initiatives seem to validate the need for a means for researchers to collaborate, but in a different way that I originally thought. This collaboration is about supplementing skills rather than knowledge. This raises [a question](https://github.com/polysoph/research/blob/master/planning.md#meta): is what I'm making about addressing large and unsolvable scientific problems, like the Polymath Project? Or is it about building an everyday tool. Which is more valuable? And to whom?
