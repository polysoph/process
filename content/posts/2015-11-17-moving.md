While I started my process blog over on [this tumblr](http://rosszurowskiworkshop.tumblr.com), I thought it best to leave it as an archive of some initial visual research, and the process of coming up with a topic.

In lieu of the tumblr, I've set up the blog you're reading right now. I hope to use this space to start archiving some of the logic and decisions that get made for this project.

I've also created a [Github org](https://github.com/polysoph). Feel free to follow my progress there as well. Open access, and all that, right?
