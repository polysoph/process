		<p>On Saturday, I had the chance to attend <a href="http://www.opencon2015.org/acs/opencon_2015_toronto">OpenCon 2015</a>, an offshoot from <a href="http://www.opencon2015.org/">a larger conference</a> in Brussels about the future of open access, open data, and open science.</p>
<p>Hosted at the Mozilla&#x2019;s Toronto office, the event involved talks from a number of local open science advocates, such as <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/">John Dupuis</a>, head of York University&#x2019;s Steacie Science Library, and <a href="https://about.me/keithmcdonald">Keith McDonald</a>, the City of Toronto&#x2019;s Open Data Lead.</p>

<p><a href="https://mozillascience.org/u/arlissc">Arliss Collin&#x2019;s</a> talk <em>Building Open Projects on the Web</em> shared interesting initiatives like <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, a workshop series to introduce scientists to the technical skills they need to manipulate and work with digital data, and <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab&#x2019;s</a> <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/collaborate">Collaborate project</a>, which helps scientists call for the help of external collaborators when their research leads them to areas outside of their expertise.</p>
<p>These initiatives seem to validate the need for a means for researchers to collaborate, but in a different way that I originally thought. This collaboration is about supplementing skills rather than knowledge. This raises <a href="https://github.com/polysoph/research/blob/master/planning.md#meta">a question</a>: is what I&#x2019;m making about addressing large and unsolvable scientific problems, like the Polymath Project? Or is it about building an everyday tool. Which is more valuable? And to whom?</p>
